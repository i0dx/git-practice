git branch [name] OR git checkout -b [name]

Fast Forward merges are the easier of the two and occur when git can easily tell the commit history of the repository,
Recursive merges are when things are a bit more complicated and changes have happened at various times and locations so a more complex algorithm is used.

git checkout [name] is used to switch between the operational branch.

git branch -d [name] is used to delete a branch 

Merge conflicts arise when there is conflicting data in the same file between two different branches.
These have to be resolved by a human user, as there is no way for git to know which is the 'right' option.
